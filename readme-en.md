# NightRaid

This was a project that I used as a testing environment to explore a little about what I was studying at the moment: <strong>Nodejs, Expressjs, HTTP methods and params.</strong>

## About

My goal was to create something simple with such technologies, so I thought I'd create a page for <a href="https://akamegakill.fandom.com/wiki/Night_Raid">NightRaid</a>, already with all the main members listed, and with the ability to add new members, update them, or delete them.
Even though it's a little incoherent in a back-end project, in the <code>GET</code> type routes I put a visual response as default, but the <code>.Json</code> can be accessed if the parameter <code>?returnJson=true</code> or <code>"returnJson": true</code> is passed as shown in the video.
In general, there is more information in the video and commented in the code about the request patterns, explanations about the routes...
